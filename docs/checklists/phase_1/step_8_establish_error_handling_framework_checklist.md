# Step 8: Establish Error Handling Framework Checklist

## Overview

The Error Handling Framework ensures that errors are handled gracefully and provide clear feedback to users. This checklist focuses on establishing the error handling framework.

## Detailed Steps

### 8.1 Write Unit Tests for Error Handling

- [x] Define expected behavior for file not found errors
- [x] Define expected behavior for database errors
- [x] Define expected behavior for network errors
- [x] Define expected behavior for invalid user input
- [x] Define expected behavior for authentication failures

### 8.2 Implement Error Handler

- [x] Handle errors gracefully
- [x] Provide clear feedback

### 8.3 Implement Custom Exceptions

- [x] Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios
- [x] Ensure clarity and actionability

### 8.4 Implement Error Logging

- [x] Log errors for debugging and monitoring
- [x] Ensure errors are logged with timestamps

### 8.5 Implement User Feedback

- [x] Provide clear and actionable error messages
- [x] Ensure users can take action to resolve errors

### 8.6 Run Integration Tests

- [x] Ensure all error handling components work together seamlessly
