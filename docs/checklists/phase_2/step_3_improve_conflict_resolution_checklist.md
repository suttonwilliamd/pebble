# Step 3: Improve Conflict Resolution Checklist

## Overview

This checklist focuses on improving conflict resolution based on user feedback and enhancing the user interface for resolving conflicts.

## Detailed Steps

### 3.1 Write Unit Tests for Improved Conflict Resolution

- [ ] Define expected behavior for detecting conflicts accurately
- [ ] Define expected behavior for providing clear conflict resolution options
- [ ] Define expected behavior for handling user input gracefully

### 3.2 Implement Improved Conflict Detection

- [ ] Improve the accuracy of conflict detection
- [ ] Identify modified files accurately

### 3.3 Write Unit Tests for Enhanced User Interface

- [ ] Define expected behavior for displaying conflicts clearly
- [ ] Define expected behavior for providing resolution options
- [ ] Define expected behavior for handling user input gracefully

### 3.4 Implement Enhanced User Interface

- [ ] Enhance the user interface for resolving conflicts
- [ ] Display conflicts clearly and provide resolution options

### 3.5 Run Integration Tests

- [ ] Ensure improved conflict resolution and enhanced user interface work together seamlessly

## Technical Details

### Improved Conflict Detection

- [ ] Algorithm: Compare snapshots to identify modified files accurately
- [ ] Efficiency: Optimize the comparison process
- [ ] Accuracy: Ensure conflicts are detected accurately

### Enhanced User Interface

- [ ] Display: Display conflicts clearly and provide resolution options
- [ ] User Input: Handle user input gracefully and provide clear feedback
- [ ] Resolution: Support multiple resolution options (e.g., ours, theirs, manual)

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] Efficient conflict detection
- [ ] Fast user interface

### Error Handling

- [ ] Conflict detection errors
- [ ] User input errors
- [ ] Resolution errors

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All unit tests for improved conflict resolution pass
- [ ] All unit tests for enhanced user interface pass
- [ ] Integration tests confirm seamless component interaction
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets

## Next Steps

- [ ] Proceed to Step 4: Develop Git Interoperability Tools
