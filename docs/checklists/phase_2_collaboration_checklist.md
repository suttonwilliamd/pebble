# Phase 2: Collaboration Development Plan Checklist

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on enhancing collaboration features, including improved remote sync, access control, and Git interoperability.

## Goals

- [ ] Enhance remote sync with resumable transfers
- [ ] Implement basic access control
- [ ] Develop Git import/export tools
- [ ] Optimize performance with delta snapshots (if validated)
- [ ] Improve conflict resolution based on user feedback

## Modules to Enhance

### 1. Remote Sync Protocol

- [ ] Enhance resumable transfers
- [ ] Implement basic access control
- [ ] Improve error handling for network issues

### 2. Snapshot System

- [ ] Implement delta snapshots (if validated)
- [ ] Optimize snapshot creation and retrieval

### 3. Combine Operation

- [ ] Improve conflict resolution based on user feedback
- [ ] Enhance user interface for resolving conflicts

### 4. Git Interoperability

- [ ] Develop tools to import Git repositories
- [ ] Develop tools to export Pebble repositories to Git

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Enhance Remote Sync Protocol

- [ ] Write unit tests for enhanced resumable transfers

- [ ] Run integration tests

### Step 2: Implement Delta Snapshots (if validated)

- [ ] Write unit tests for delta snapshot creation
- [ ] Implement delta snapshot creation
- [ ] Write unit tests for delta snapshot retrieval
- [ ] Implement delta snapshot retrieval
- [ ] Run integration tests

### Step 3: Improve Conflict Resolution

- [ ] Write unit tests for improved conflict resolution
- [ ] Implement improved conflict resolution
- [ ] Enhance user interface for resolving conflicts
- [ ] Run integration tests

### Step 4: Develop Git Interoperability Tools

- [ ] Write unit tests for Git import tools
- [ ] Implement Git import tools
- [ ] Write unit tests for Git export tools
- [ ] Implement Git export tools
- [ ] Run integration tests

### Step 5: Optimize Performance

- [ ] Benchmark current performance
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and optimize critical paths
- [ ] Run performance tests

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit Tests
- [ ] Integration Tests
- [ ] Performance Tests
- [ ] Stress Tests

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests confirm seamless component interaction
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Stress tests validate scalability
- [ ] Git interoperability tools are functional

## Git Instructions

- [ ] Commit changes periodically
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub regularly
- [ ] Use branches for experimental features

## Next Steps

- [ ] Proceed to Phase 3: Enterprise
