# Phase 2: Collaboration Development Plan Checklist

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on enhancing collaboration features, including improved remote sync, access control, and Git interoperability.

## Goals

- [x] Enhance remote sync with resumable transfers
- [x] Implement basic access control
- [x] Develop Git import/export tools
- [x] Optimize performance with delta snapshots (if validated)
- [x] Improve conflict resolution based on user feedback

## Modules to Enhance

### 1. Remote Sync Protocol

- [x] Enhance resumable transfers
- [x] Implement basic access control
- [x] Improve error handling for network issues

### 2. Snapshot System

- [x] Implement delta snapshots (if validated)
- [x] Optimize snapshot creation and retrieval

### 3. Combine Operation

- [x] Improve conflict resolution based on user feedback
- [x] Enhance user interface for resolving conflicts

### 4. Git Interoperability

- [x] Develop tools to import Git repositories
- [x] Develop tools to export Pebble repositories to Git

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Enhance Remote Sync Protocol
